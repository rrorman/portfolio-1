### <mark style="background-color: lightgreen">**Dataset Description**</mark>

The data that I am going to be working with is pulled from a study called [**"Effects of Sexualized Video Games on Online Sexual Harassment"**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30614006/) by Jonathan Burnay and others in 2019. 

I obtained this dataset from the *Harvard Dataverse*. [Here is a link to the site where I located this dataset.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/9TFDEV&version=1.0)

The premise of this study was to see if sexualization of female video game characters impacts one's sexual harassment behaviors online. Participants played a video game where the characters were either sexualized or non-sexualized. After the game, the participant had the opportunity to sexually harass a male or female partner by sending them sexist jokes.  

### <mark style="background-color: lightgreen">**Variables**</mark>

In this study, the main manipulated variable was *sexualization of the female video game characters*. This was manipulated by changing the outfit of the characters. 

In the **non-sexualized condition (NS)**, both characters wore non-revealing outfits. In the **highly-sexualized condition (S)**, both characters wore revealing swimsuits. 

The main dependent variable was the measure of *online sexual harassment*. After playing the video game, participants were exposed to a series of both sexist and non-sexist jokes to send to an online partner that was either male or female. 

The **number of sexist jokes that the participant chose to send to their partner was measured**. There were **8** total sexist jokes that could be sent by the participant, thus, the measure of the dependent variable could range from **0 to 8.** 

After playing the video game, participants rated the level of difficulty, fun, frustration, excitement, competitive, realistic, and violent the game was. Their responses were rated on a scale of **1-10, 1 = not at all, and 10 = very much.**

Other variables that might be related to online sexual harassment were measured and controlled for using measures of **Hostile Sexism (HS), Benevolent Sexism (BS), Trait Aggression (GA), and Online Disinhibition (ODS)**. HS and BS were rated on a scale of 0-5, with 0 = totally disagree and 5 = totally agree. GA and ODS were rated on a scale of 1-6, with 1 = not at all like me, and 6 = extremely like me. 

| Variable | Type | Measure |
| :------: | :--: | :-----: |
| Sexualization | Character | NS, S |
| Sexual Harassment | Integer | 0-8 |

### <mark style="background-color: lightgreen">**Set Up**</mark>

First, I am going to load the required packages and the data set. 

```{r}
#load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
#load data set
load(file = here::here("data", "Results_Sexual_Harassment.RData"))

#change data set name
raw_sex_harassment <- table
```

Next, I am going to change some of the variable names to more useful ones to make the data set easier to read and digest. Here, I take out some variables that are not useful to what we're going to be looking at. 

```{r}
#subset and wrangle the data
subset_sex_harassment <- raw_sex_harassment |> 
  select(-USFIVPlayer, -Suspicious, -Player) |> 
  rename(
    participant = Code,
    sexualization = Sexualization, 
    partner_gender = partnergender,
    participant_gender = Participantgender,
    age = Age,
    hour_per_week = Hourweek,
    sexist_jokes = Sesistjokes,
    difficulty_rating = VGDifficulty,
    fun_rating = VGFun,
    frustration_rating = VGFrustration,
    excite_rating = VGExcitement,
    competitive_rating = VGcompetitive,
    realistic_rating = VGreaslit,
    violent_rating = VGviolent, 
    hs = HS,
    bs = BS,
    ga = GA,
    ods = ODS
  )
```

Here is a glimpse of what the raw data set looks like. 

```{r}
print(subset_sex_harassment)
```

The **Raw Sexual Harassment** data set has the number of sexist jokes that the participant sent to their partner, so our focal variables will be <mark style="background-color: white">`sexist_jokes`, `sexualization`, `partner_gender`, and `participant_gender`.</mark>

```{r}
new_sex_harassment <- subset_sex_harassment |> 
  select(participant, sexist_jokes, sexualization, partner_gender, participant_gender)


sexualized_sex_harassment <- new_sex_harassment |> 
  filter(partner_gender == "F",
         participant_gender == "M")

summary_sex_harassment <- sexualized_sex_harassment |> 
  group_by(sexualization) |> 
  summarize(mean = mean(sexist_jokes))


ggplot(summary_sex_harassment) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = sexualization, y = mean), stat = "identity")
```
